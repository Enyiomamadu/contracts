# Web Development Contract

- Project: **{{project-name}}**
- Date: **{{contract-date}}**
- Client: **{{client}}**, represented by **{{contact-name}}** ({{contact-email}})
- Contractor: **{{my-name}}** ({{my-email}})

## Summary

As a professional, I will always do my best to fulfill your needs and meet your expectations. In order for the project to run smoothly, it is important to have things written down so that we both know who should do what and when, and what will happen if something goes wrong.

In this contract you won't find any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text. I have no desire to trick you into signing something that you might later regret. I simply want what's best for both parties, now and in the future.

Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a legal document under exclusive jurisdiction of United States courts.

To summarise:

**You, {{client}}, represented by {{contact-name}} ({{contact-email}}), are hiring me, {{my-name}}, ({{my-email}}), for {{service-description}} services at the rate of ${{hourly-rate}} per hour.**

## What do both parties agree to do?

### You:

- You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company or your organization.
- You'll give me everything I need to complete the project as and when and in the format I need it.
- You'll review my work, provide feedback and approval in a timely manner.
- You agree to be bound to any deadlines we set together.
- You agree to stick to the payment schedule set out at the end of this contract.

### Me:

- I have the experience and ability to do everything I've discussed with you and I'll do it all in a professional and timely manner.
- I'll endeavour to meet every deadline that's set.
- I'll maintain the confidentiality of everything you give me.
- I'll notify you as soon as possible if I cannot carry out any task that has been set by you, including due to any unforeseen circumstances ("Force Majeure" in legalese).

## The work

The project scope is as follows:

{{project-scope-description}}

---

As this project will be undertaken at an hourly rate, the above project scope description is a guide rather than concrete requirements for the application. The requirements will be agreed in writing and I will complete tasks to fulfil the requirements in a timely and professional manner, providing that the requirements adhere generally to the original project scope.

The requirements for the work can be changed at any time, and I will endeavour to alter the application to meet the new requirements in a timely manner, provided that they still adhere generally to the original project scope.

If a task cannot be completed for any reason, I shall flag this up and notify you as soon as possible. This may include tasks that are significantly different from the original project scope.

## Browser testing

Due to the nature of the web, it is difficult (if not impossible) to ensure that an application will appear pixel-perfect in every web browser. Instead, I will ensure that a user's experience of the application will be appropriate to the capabilities of a browser or device.

With my assistance (if required), you will provide a list of browsers that should be supported and I will test as appropriate. If required, I can provide advice on the browsers that should be supported, given the project scope and time to integrate and test. I cannot guarantee that I will have access to all browsers for testing -- if I do not have access to a browser that is requested, I shall notify you as soon as possible.

## Collaboration & Delivery

You agree to provide a version controlled online repository for me to push code to. I agree to push code to this repository on a regular basis for assessment and analysis. You also agree to provide instructions on how to set up the development environment necessary for building and testing the application locally.

## Copyrights

You guarantee that all elements of text, images or other artwork you provide are either owned by you, or that you have permission to use them.

I guarantee that you have permission to use any assets or third party software libraries that I have sourced for use in the application. If you need to pay for this permission, I shall notify you before using the asset and await your go-ahead.

Full Intellectual Property ownership shall transfer to you on receipt of payment for the work undertaken.

I reserve the right, with your permission, to display and link to your project as part of my portfolio and to write about it on websites, in magazine articles, and in books.

## Payments

I shall invoice for the work undertaken on the project on a twice-monthly basis (1st and 15th of each month), after the work has been undertaken, at the rate of **${{hourly-rate}} per hour**. You agree to pay the terms of the invoice within **{{payment-deadline-in-days}} days**.

## Authorisation

You are hiring me as an independent freelancer, not a full-time employee. This means that while I will strive to complete the project in a timely and professional manner, I retain the right to work where and how I want.

You agree that, if required, I may access your hosting account, database provider and other systems for the sole purpose of completing the project.

## Term

To terminate this agreement, I must provide **{{termination-notice-in-days}} days** notice to you, and vice versa. Otherwise, this agreement doesn't need to be renewed, and will expire at the end of the project.

If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place.

## Confidentiality

Both parties agree that any confidential information shared regarding the project will not be divulged to other parties, unless both parties agree to do so. This provision will remain in place even after the agreement has been terminated.

## Other legal stuff

I can't guarantee that my work will be error-free and so I can't be liable to you or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you've advised me of them.

You can't transfer this contract to anyone else (for example, another company) without my permission.
